# Contributing

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to our collection of free software development resources! Our goal is to build a comprehensive, easy-to-navigate, and up-to-date repository that can help developers at all levels. Whether you're looking to add new resources, update existing ones, or improve the site's functionality, your contributions are invaluable.

## Adding New Resources

1. Find a Resource: Identify a free software development resource that is not already listed on our site. We welcome resources on coding, frameworks, design, tools, and more.

2. Verify the Resource: Ensure the resource is free, reputable, and provides value to developers.

3. Gather Information: For each resource, we need the following information:

   - Title: The name of the resource.
   - Description: A brief description of what the resource offers.
   - URL: The direct link to the resource.

4. Submit a Pull Request: Fork our repository, add your resource to the appropriate category in the JSON file (following the format provided above), and submit a pull request. Please provide a brief explanation of the resource and why you think it's valuable.

## Updating Existing Resources

1. Identify Outdated Information: If you notice that a resource's description, title, or URL is outdated or incorrect, we'd appreciate your help in updating it.

2. Submit a Pull Request: Make the necessary changes in your forked version of the repository and submit a pull request with a brief description of the changes you've made.

## Resource format

```json

  "name": "The name of the resource",
